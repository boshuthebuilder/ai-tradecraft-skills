# Changelog

Releases are semver tags (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`); what counts as a breaking change is defined by
the versioned interface in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Consumers pin a tag and advance it
deliberately.

## Unreleased

### Added
- `AGENTS.md` (+ `CLAUDE.md` symlink): working constraints — the genericness rule, the versioned
  interface, and this release protocol.
- This changelog.

## v0.x — pre-versioning history (summary)

Everything before the first tag, in brief: the wiki skill family (`wiki-onboarding`,
`wiki-maintenance`), the `project-onboarding` flow with the **file-ingest** archetype
(`ingest` + `reconcile`, `id == mode`, reactive gate + periodic pass), and `ARCHITECTURE.md`
reframing the repo as a general job framework for a headless assisting system (wiki as the
first layer, not the boundary). Consumers pinned bare commit SHAs during this period.
